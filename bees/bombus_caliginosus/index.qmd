## Observation notes  
Easily confused with Bombus vonesenskii due to almost identical color pattern, but females typically have white hairs on the underside of the abdomen. B. caliginosus is known to Washington state and likely is also present in the Pacific Maritime. See B. vosnesenski for more info.

## GBIF observations  
No GBIF observations in Pacific Maritime to display.
