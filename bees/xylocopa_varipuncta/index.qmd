## Observation notes  
OSU Insect Collection: (R.C.Osburn), 1949, Capilano Canyon. Note: this was likely a failed introduction of the species and that if the record is valid, that it has not established or been detected since. It is a more southern species, which at this time, does not survive outside of the central valley of California (LR Best, personal communication).

## GBIF observations  
No GBIF observations in Pacific Maritime to display.
