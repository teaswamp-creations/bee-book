# Big Book of Bees!

Our Big Book of Bees features a gallery of `r nrow(df)` wild bee species that have been documented in BC’s Pacific Maritime region at one time or another between 1854 and Nov 2025. The gallery is based on an annotated catalogue prepared by Lincoln Best of native bees in this region (observations to 2013, private communication), and includes information from the checklist published by [Sheffield and Heron in 2018](https://journal.entsocbc.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/1001). It also includes new findings since 2018 in published literature, [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) (research grade), [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/), the [BC Bee Atlas](https://www.bcnativebees.org/bc-bee-atlas), and the [Galiano Biodiversity Life List](https://biogaliano.org/taxa/). 

Images have been collected from iNaturalist (creative commons license), as well as from the [Spencer Entomological Collection (SEC)](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/entomology/), to whom we give special thanks for allowing us to reproduce their specimen images for this book.

# Why we made this book

We made this book to provide easy access to information that can help you identify native bees that have been found in BC’s Pacific Maritime region. The photo gallery lets you compare your bee picture or specimen to species known to be in the region, and links to GBIF and iNaturalist maps show you where and when different species have been observed.

We focus on the Pacific Maritime region, and link out to records of the same species if they've been spotted elsewhere in the world. Our goal is not to duplicate functionality of well-established aggregators, but to provide different options for organizing and visualizing the same data.

# Feedback

If you find this resource useful we'd love to hear about it! Let us know using our [survey page](https://forms.gle/WQtfTvAeJDGKkrP37). Any comments and feedback re missing bees, incorrect entries, etc. are also much appreciated!

# Example usage

The species pages are set up to help answer "When was this species last seen in the Pacific Maritime?"

-   Select a species in the gallery
-   Check out the GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) map where available
-   Compare with your own observations to help identify bees

## Observation notes

Bee pages have notes on historical observations curated from literature. See our [references page](references.html) for a complete list of sources.

An observation note is formatted as follows: Author et al., date of publication: (Name of observer), date collected, <span class="hl-place-name">location collected</span>. For example:

> Guzman et al., 2023: (Gielens), 2010, <span class="hl-place-name">Vancouver Island</span>

# Ecozones of British Columbia

This resource focuses on the Pacific Maritime ecozone in BC, Canada. For the exact polygon definition we used for this ecozone, see the GBIF data DOI link below.

# Bee families in the Pacific Maritime

These maps show observations from GBIF for bee families in the Pacific Maritime. Double click any genus to isolate it on the map. Several historical datasets are represented in our GBIF data, [downloaded December 12th 2025](https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.cs2xsc).
