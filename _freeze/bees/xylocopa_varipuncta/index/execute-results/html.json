Note: this was likely a failed introduction of the species and that if the record is valid, that it has not established or been detected since. It is a more southern species, which at this time, does not survive outside of the central valley of California (LR Best, personal communication).\n\n## GBIF observations  \nNo GBIF observations in Pacific Maritime to display.\n<br><br>\n<center>\n\n\n<a href=\"NA\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-secondary\">See all Xylocopa varipuncta <i class=\"fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square\"></i> </button></a>\n</center>\n",
